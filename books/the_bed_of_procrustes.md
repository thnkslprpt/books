>The person you are the most afraid to contradict is yourself.

>An idea starts to be interesting when you get scared of taking it to its logical conclusion.

>To bankrupt a fool, give him information.

>I suspect that they put Socrates to death because there is something terribly unat ractive, alienating, and nonhuman in thinking with too much clarity.

>Education makes the wise slightly wiser, but it makes the fool vastly more dangerous.

>If your anger decreases with time, you did injustice; if it increases, you suf ered injustice.

>If you know, in the morning, what your day looks like with any precision, you are a lit le bit dead—the more precision, the more dead you are.

>There is no intermediate state between ice and water but there is one between life and death: employment.

>You have a calibrated life when most of what you fear has the titil ating prospect of adventure.

>Procrastination is the soul rebel ing against entrapment.

>The best revenge on a liar is to convince him that you believe what he said.

>When we want to do something while unconsciously certain to fail, we seek advice so we can blame someone else for the failure.

>Never say no twice if you mean it.

>If you want people to read a book, tel them it is overrated.

>I wonder whether a bit er enemy would be jealous if he discovered that I hated someone else.

>The test of whether you real y liked a book is if you reread it (and how many times); the test of whether you real y liked someone’s company is if you are ready to meet him again and again—the rest is spin, or that variety of sentiment now cal ed self-esteem.

>It is as dif icult to avoid bugging others with advice on how to exercise and other health mat ers as it is to stick to an exercise schedule.

>When she shouts that what you did was unforgivable, she has already started to forgive you.

>You exist if and only if you are free to do things without a visible objective, with no justi cation and, above al , outside the dictatorship of someone else’s narrative.

>To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week’s newspapers.

>The opposite of success isn’t failure; it is name-dropping.

>Older people are most beautiful when they have what is lacking in the young: poise, erudition, wisdom, phronesis, and this post-heroic absence of agitation.

>What fools cal “wasting time” is most often the best investment.

>You want to avoid being disliked without being envied or admired.

>Read nothing from the past one hundred years; eat no fruits from the past one thousand years; drink nothing from the past four thousand years (just wine and water); but talk to no ordinary man over forty. A man without a heroic bent starts dying at the age of thirty.

>Karl Marx, a visionary, figured out that you can control a slave much bet er by convincing him he is an employee.

>The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich.

>You wil be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt.

>Someone who says “I am busy” is either declaring incompetence (and lack of control of his life) or trying to get rid of you.

>The difference between slaves in Roman and Ot oman days and today’s employees is that slaves did not need to flat er their boss.

>You are rich if and only if money you refuse tastes bet er than money you accept.

>For most, success is the harmful passage from the camp of the hating to the camp of the hated.

>To see if you like where you are, without the chains of dependence, check if you are as happy returning as you were leaving.

>The difference between love and happiness is that those who talk about love tend to be in love, but those who talk about happiness tend to be not happy.

>Modernity: we created youth without heroism, age without wisdom, and life without grandeur.

>You can tel how uninteresting a person is by asking him whom he finds interesting.

>I wonder if anyone ever measured the time it takes, at a party, before a mildly successful stranger who went to Harvard makes others aware of it.

>People focus on role models; it is more ef ective to find antimodels—people you don’t want to resemble when you grow up.

>Preoccupation with ef icacy is the main obstacle to a poetic, noble, elegant, robust, and heroic life.

>Don’t complain too loud about wrongs done you; you may give ideas to your less imaginative enemies.

>Most feed their obsessions by trying to get rid of them.

>Charm is the ability to insult people without of ending them; nerdiness the reverse.

>Those who do not think that employment is systemic slavery are either blind or employed.

>They are born, then put in a box; they go home to live in a box; they study by ticking boxes; they go to what is cal ed “work” in a box, where they sit in their cubicle box; they drive to the grocery store in a box to buy food in a box; they go to the gym in a box to sit in a box; they talk about thinking “outside the box”; and when they die they are put in a box. Al boxes, Euclidian, geometrical y smooth boxes.

>Rumors are only valuable when they are denied.

>Over the long term, you are more likely to fool yourself than others.

>There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same.

>It is those who use others who are the most upset when someone uses them.

>The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.

>My only measure of success is how much time you have to kil

>Technology can degrade (and endanger) every aspect of a sucker’s life while convincing him that it is becoming more “ef icient.”

>You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits.

>Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura.

>We are hunters; we are only truly alive in those moments when we improvise; no schedule, just smal surprises and stimuli from the environment.

>For everything, use boredom in place of a clock, as a biological wristwatch, though under constraints of politeness.

>Writing is the art of repeating oneself without anyone noticing.

>Writers are remembered for their best work, politicians for their worst mistakes, and businessmen are almost never remembered.

>You need to keep reminding yourself of the obvious: charm lies in the unsaid, the unwrit en, and the undisplayed. It takes mastery to control silence.

>No author should be considered as having failed until he starts teaching others about writing.

>A good maxim al ows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.

>Some books cannot be summarized (real literature, poetry); some can be compressed to about ten pages; the majority to zero pages.

>What I learned on my own I stil remember.

>The tragedy is that much of what you think is random is in your control and, what’s worse, the opposite.

>The sucker’s trap is when you focus on what you know and what others don’t know, rather than the reverse.

>Finer men tolerate others’ smal inconsistencies though not the large ones; the weak tolerate others’ large inconsistencies though not smal ones.

>My biggest problem with modernity may lie in the growing separation of the ethical and the legal.*

>Trust people who make a living lying down or standing up more than those who do so sit ing down. The tragedy of virtue is that the more obvious, boring, unoriginal, and sermonizing the proverb, the harder it is to implement.

>I trust everyone except those who tel me they are trustworthy.

>People often need to suspend their self-promotion, and have someone in their lives they do not need to impress. This explains dog ownership.

>In a crowd of a hundred, 50 percent of the wealth, 90 percent of the imagination, and 100 percent of the intel ectual courage wil reside in a single person—not necessarily the same one.

>Just as dyed hair makes older men less at ractive, it is what you do to hide your weaknesses that makes them repugnant.

>You are only secure if you can lose your fortune without the additional worse insult of having to become humble.*

>To test someone’s robustness to reputational errors, ask a man in front of an audience if he is “stil doing poorly” or if he is “stil losing money” and watch his reaction.

>Robustness is progress without impatience.

>When conflicted between two choices, take neither.

>To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.

>In twenty-ve centuries, no human came along with the bril iance, depth, elegance, wit, and imagination to match Plato—to protect us from his legacy.

>Why do I have an obsessive Plato problem? Most people need to surpass their predecessors; Plato managed to surpass al his successors.

>To be a philosopher is to know through long walks, by reasoning, and reasoning only, a priori, what others can only potential y learn from their mistakes, crises, accidents, and bankruptcies—that is, a posteriori.

>Conscious ignorance, if you can practice it, expands your world; it can make things infinite.

>The best test of whether someone is extremely stupid (or extremely wise) is whether financial and political news makes sense to him.

>You can be certain that the head of a corporation has a lot to worry about when he announces publicly that “there is nothing to worry about.”

>Mediocre men tend to be outraged by smal insults but passive, subdued, and silent in front of very large ones.†

>Those who have nothing to prove never say that they have nothing to prove.

>The traits I respect are erudition and the courage to stand up when half-men are afraid for their reputation. Any idiot can be intel igent.

>A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence.

>You know you have influence when people start noticing your absence more than the presence of others.

>Love without sacrifice is like theft.

>If my detractors knew me bet er they would hate me even more.

>The general theme of my work is the limitations of human knowledge, and the charming and less charming errors and biases when working with mat ers that lie outside our eld of observation, the unobserved and the unobservables—the unknown; what lies on the other side of the veil of opacity. Because our minds need to reduce information, we are more likely to try to squeeze a phenomenon into the Procrustean bed of a crisp and known category (amputating the unknown), rather than suspend categorization, and make it tangible. Thanks to our detections of false pat erns, along with real ones, what is random wil appear less random and more certain—our overactive brains are more likely to impose the wrong, simplistic narrative than no narrative at al .* The mind can be a wonderful tool for self-delusion—it was not designed to deal with complexity and nonlinear uncertainties.* Counter to the common discourse, more information means more delusions: our detection of false pat erns is growing faster and faster as a side e ect of modernity and the information age: there is this mismatch between the messy randomness of the information-rich current world, with its complex interactions, and our intuitions of events, derived in a simpler ancestral habitat. Our mental architecture is at an increased mismatch with the world in which we live. This leads to sucker problems: when the map does not correspond to the territory, there is a certain category of fool—the overeducated, the academic, the journalist, the newspaper reader, the mechanistic “scientist,” the pseudo-empiricist, those endowed with what I cal “epistemic arrogance,” this wonderful ability to discount what they did not see, the unobserved—who enter a state of denial, imagining the territory as t ing his map. More general y, the fool here is someone who does the wrong reduction for the sake of reduction, or removes something essential, cut ing o the legs, or, bet er, part of the head of a visitor while insisting that he preserved his persona with 95 percent accuracy. Look around at the Procrustean beds we’ve created, some bene cial, some more questionable: regulations, top-down governments, academia, gyms, commutes, high-rise of ice buildings, involuntary human relationships, employment, etc.Since the Enlightenment, in the great tension between rationalism (how we would like things to be so they make sense to us) and empiricism (how things are), we have been blaming the world for not t ing the beds of “rational” models, have tried to change humans to t technology, fudged our ethics to t our needs for employment, asked economic life to t the theories of economists, and asked human life to squeeze into some narrative. We are robust when errors in the representation of the unknown and understanding of random e ects do not lead to adverse outcomes —fragile otherwise. The robust bene ts from Black Swan events,* the fragile is severely hit by them. We are more and more fragile to a certain brand of scienti c autism making con dent claims about the unknown—leading to expert problems, risk, massive dependence on human error. As the reader can see from my aphorisms, I have respect for mother nature’s methods of robustness (bil ions of years al ow most of what is fragile to break); classical thought is more robust (in its respect for the unknown, the epistemic humility) than the modern post-Enlightenment naïve pseudoscienti c autism. Thus my classical values make me advocate the triplet of erudition, elegance, and courage; against modernity’s phoniness, nerdiness, and philistinism.* Art is robust; science, not always (to put it mildly). Some Procrustean beds make life worth living: art and, the most potent of al , the poetic aphorism.

>By set ing oneself total y free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity cal ed work, free of e orts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes.
