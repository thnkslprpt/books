>How to Understand Yourself Better

>The energy model: Are you living in the here and now? > 
>The three examples shown in the model on the right can also represent cultural values: memory-driven, in nostalgic Europe; dream-driven, in the USA, the ‘land of opportunity’; and reality-driven, in industrious Asia.

>How to Understand Others Better

>The Maslow pyramids: What you actually need, what you actually want > 
>The three most important questions,’ begins the 2003 German film Hierankl, ‘are: Are you having sex? Do you have a family? Are you intellectually stimulated? Scoring three yeses is paradise; two yeses is what you need to be happy, and one yes is what you need to survive.’ The film is bad, but the questions it asks are good.

>The black swan model: Why your experiences don’t make you any wiser > 
>In his 1912 book The Problems of Philosophy, Bertrand Russell summarised the answers to all three questions: a chicken that expects to be fed every day assumes that it will continue to be fed every day. It starts to firmly believe that humans are kind. Nothing in the chicken’s life points to the fact that one day it will be slaughtered. We humans also have to acknowledge that the biggest catastrophes usually come as a complete surprise to us. That’s why, according to Russell, we should always question the things we take for granted.
